Overview
********

Credit-based shaping is an alternative scheduling algorithm used in
network schedulers to achieve fairness when sharing a limited network
resource.  Zephyr has support for configuring a credit-based shaper
described in the `IEEE 802.1Qav-2009 standard`_. Zephyr does not
implement the actual shaper; it only provides a way to configure the
shaper implemented by the Ethernet device driver.
